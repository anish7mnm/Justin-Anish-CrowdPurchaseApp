The idea for DVVY popped up in response to difficulties we were having with organizing collective decisions like signing up for group classes or planning parties where friends chip in.

The current methods of organizing these are email threads or Facebook events, but neither are really effective for addressing situations where some invitees would commit to the event only if a certain minimum number of others had committed.

The main goal of DVVY is to provide a more convenient digital space for people who want to organize group events where pooling the money together would benefit each individual.

A user can create a campaign for an event, send out invites, have invitees set the maximum price they're willing to pay, and the app would automatically calculate whether or not each invitee's condition can be met before either confirming them as an attendee or waiting for more commits.
